2. REPORT DETAILS

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_i/interruptControllerS_0/inst/inst1/int_sources_prev_reg[3]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/interruptControllerS_0/inst/inst1/int_sources_prev_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell design_1_i/interruptControllerS_0/inst/inst1/int_sources_prev_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_i/interruptControllerS_0/inst/inst1/pending_reg[3]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/interruptControllerS_0/inst/inst1/pending_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell design_1_i/interruptControllerS_0/inst/inst1/pending_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port pin_0[0] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#2 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port pin_0[1] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#3 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port pin_0[2] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#4 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port pin_0[3] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#5 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port pin_0[4] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#6 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port pin_0[5] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#7 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port pin_0[6] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#8 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port pin_0[7] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
