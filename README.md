# VeSPA SoC
This repository is dedicated to the VeSPA (Very Small Processor Architecture) SoC (System-on-Chip) designed for the Embedded Systems 2023/2024  class.

## Repository Layout
On the main branch it is possible to find the latest working version of the VeSPA SoC.  Contributors must ensure the main branch is always a fully functional working copy. For testing changes to the VeSPA SoC, temporary branches can be created, changes can first be performed on this branches and later on merged back to the main branch.

## Contributing
In order to keep the repository as organized as possible, the contributors should follow some guidelines. Some of this guidelines include:
- Ensure build and temporary folders and files are not added to the repository (Specify a .gitignore if one is not specified on the branch you are working on).
- Keep your code well documented, as well as provide extra documentation when relevant.
- Folder structure should be as follows: Base Folder -> Vivado | Docs. Place the project files on the Vivado folder, and relevant documentation (Drawio files, doxygen generated docs...) on the Docs folder.
- The readme of each branch should be customized to shortly describe said branch.
